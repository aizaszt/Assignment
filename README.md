This project demonstrates the concept of abstraction and polymorphism in Python using an abstract base class for 3D shapes.
It defines a common interface for different 3D objects (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) and calculates their surface area and volume through that interface.

The project is organized into three files for better structure:
	•	shape3d.py — Defines the abstract base class Shape3D with abstract methods surface_area() and volume().
	•	shapes.py — Implements concrete classes: Sphere, Cylinder, and Cube, each with formulas to calculate surface area and volume.
	•	main.py — Contains the main logic: generates a list of 10 random shape objects, calculates and displays their properties.
